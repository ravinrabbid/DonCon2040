# DonConIO - Signal Conditioning for the DonCon2040

---

## NOTICE

**DEPRECATED.**

While this board will still work fine, I recommend using the [DonConIOmini](/pcb/DonConIOmini). It hosts the same circuit using mainly SMD parts, resulting in a smaller footprint and better noise characteristics.

---

This board hosts a Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 microcontroller unit and provides signal conditioning for the piezo drum triggers. The conditioning circuit is reverse engineered from the *V260 SIF PCB* found in the original arcades. This is also the main reason why this board uses mainly through hole parts ... for *authenticity*.

## Sensors

The arcade drum uses *Sensatec GSS-4SD* piezo impact sensors. While those are only available as expensive arcade spare parts, the *GSS-4SA* and *GSS-4SC* variants used in this build can be readily ordered directly from the manufacturer. My guess here is that the *D* variant only uses a different cable and connector, but who knows ...

You can also try your luck with any generic piezo, in this case you might have to tune the filters and amplification factor.

## Notes

- If the sensitivity for a pad feels to low you can try to increase the feedback resistor (R3,R13,R21,R30) of the affected pad for more amplification.
- This board does not use the internal ADCs of the RP2040 since those are pretty noisy and have a static offset of around +25mV. You can however still skip the external ADC and level-shifter and connect the signals directly to ADC pins of the XIAO RP2040 if you want to save some cost.
